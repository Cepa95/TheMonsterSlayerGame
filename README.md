## Rules:
- During the game, you have the ability to initiate attacks, but it's important to note that the monster also has the capability to retaliate and attack you.  
- As a special feature, every fifth turn presents an opportunity for you to unleash a powerful special attack.  
- Additionally, at every other turn, you have the option to engage in a gamble. In this scenario, the monster will attack you, but you'll also have the chance to heal yourself. It's worth mentioning that the monster's attack might cause more damage than your healing, or vice versa.  
- Furthermore, there is a special ability called "Heal Everyone" that can be used once during the game. When activated, both the monster and the player are healed by 20 points.  
- The game will continue until either the monster or the player's health points reach 0 or player surrenders, at which point the game concludes.
